Hey! Just a little bug fix (i guess)

-opened the vent for testing (i couldnt find my playfab bruh)
-added leaderboard (actually this time) 

there is a leaderboard in the mod room, in the stump, and simulation

all moderator cosmetics are public for now because i dont feel like setting up allat

Enjoy, and give me feedback and suggestions pls
